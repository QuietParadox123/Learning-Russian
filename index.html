			<h2>Greetings</h2>
				<p>Hello fellow pursuers of knowledge. My name is Emily and I really enjoy foreign languages and building websites </br>
				plus I needed a little refresher course on my knowledge of HTML and CSS so the noodle up in my head had a great thought! </br>
					<i>Why not make a website about my learning of the Russian language?</i></br>
				So here I am and here you are.</br>
				I in no way what-so-ever am a master of this language, I'll probably make lots of mistakes, but I do my best. I'm still</br>
				learning just as you are likely learning (To be honest here it is rather likely that I'll even make mistakes in English too).</br>
				But if you are much farther along in your study of the Russian language and do notice a mistake of mine please do not hesitate </br>
				to message me in some form or another...I'll come up with some way to do that eventually...</br>
				So without further adieu I welcome you to my website. Click on one of the buttons to the side to bring yourself that section of</br>
				the site and begin your journey into the Russian language with me. It's going to be a bumpy ride</p>

				web-sites, studying</br>
				languages or procrastinating</br>
